## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#22C55E) from the existing design system should be the main color throughout the app for a sense of health and vitality. Keep the warning orange (#F97316) and danger red (#EF4444) for products with questionable and not recommended status, respectively.
- Background color: Use a light grey (#F8F9FA) for the background, and white (#FFFFFF) for cards to create a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: A slightly darker shade of green (#16A34A) should be used for CTAs and interactive elements to provide contrast and guide the user's attention.
- Body and headline font: Per user request, retain existing typgraphy specified in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (system font stack) to ensure the MVP can quickly leverage existing fonts. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Lucide React icons: The existing icon set shall continue to be utilized across the app, focusing on icons related to food, health, and scanning for a cohesive look.
- Maintain the layout: Use a max width of 448px (28rem) and padding of 1.5rem (24px) horizontal, create clear visual hierarchy, adequate spacing, and consistent styling for elements such as buttons, cards, and headers across all screens.
- Implement subtle animations: Consider adding animations for scanning, transitions, and feedback, but ensure they do not detract from the user experience or impact performance negatively.
